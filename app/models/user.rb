# Key concept: use an exception to indicate an error when deleting the user.
	# Purposes:
	# 1. Because it's raised inside a transaction, it causes an automatic rollback.
	# 2. signals the error back to the controller, where we use a begin/end 
	# => block to handle it and report the error to the user in the flash. 

	# If you only want to abort the transaction but not signal an exception, 
	# raise an ActiveRecord::Rollback exception instead, because this is the 
	# only exception that wonâ€™t be passed on by ActiveRecord::Base.transaction.
